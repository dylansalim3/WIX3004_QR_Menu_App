## Purpose of Project
- To create a mobile application that enables users to customize and generate catalog menus digitally
- To enable the ease of accessing digitalized menu through QR code

## Background:

In the past decades, shops like restaurants and bars list their services in a printed, laminated menu, a traditional way. However, more and more shops are adapting to the digital era we are currently live in. Some of them digitalize their menus by either creating their own mobile or web application, enabling customers to access the menu in the application and also aiming to reduce the waste or paper for ecological purposes. However, not all shop owners are willing to or have the capability of hiring a development team for doing so. Hence, a solution to address this problem is much needed.

## Objective:

To decrease the risk of contact by browsing physical menu, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To save merchant resources on printing menu and replacing new menu from time to time.

To follow the trend of digital business transformation
